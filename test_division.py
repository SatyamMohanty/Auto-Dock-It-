
The code in `test_division.py` is attempting to divide by zero, which is an invalid operation in Python. When this happens, Python throws a `ZeroDivisionError`, indicating that the attempted division by zero was illegal.

To fix this error, you can modify the test code to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` and assert that it is thrown:
```python
def test_division_by_zero():
    try:
        result = 1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Expected ZeroDivisionError")
```
This modified code will catch the `ZeroDivisionError` and pass the test.
